# ShoreaCryptoAlertBot
This repository is a small side project by me. As my friends and i are getting into crypto, we would want a bot in our telegram group to check for the current Binance price for any Crypto token

## Things you need to open this project

1. You need to get a set of API keys and security keys from Binance
2. You need to get a token from Telegram BotFather

## How to run the project?

1. Install the npm dependencies by running `npm install`.
2. Start the project by running `npm start`. 
3. After these steps you can send the commands to the Telegram bot to get the prices for cryptocurrencies, for example, `/coin ADA` (for getting the price of Cardano in USDT). Type `/coin ADA BTC`(for getting the price of Cardano in BTC)
